title: Idiqlat - Design
fontversion: 1.110
---

The Idiqlat font supports the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The original font on which Idiqlat was based was an [OFL](https://openfontlicense.org/)-licensed typeface called **East Syriac Marcus**, designed as a revival of metal type. However, significant design changes have been made in order to modernize and opitimize the font for web and mobile use. The Latin letters are a subset of the [Crimson Pro](https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro) font.

Three fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Idiqlat* release:

* Idiqlat ExtraLight
* Idiqlat Light
* Idiqlat Regular
