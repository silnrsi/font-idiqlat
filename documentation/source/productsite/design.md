The Idiqlat font supports the East Syriac style of the Syriac script.

This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East Syriac Marcus. The original design was a revival of metal type. Idiqlat is closely inspired by that foundation, but the design has been modernized and opitimized for web and mobile use.

The Latin glyphs were imported from Crimson Pro.

Three fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Idiqlat* release:

* Idiqlat ExtraLight
* Idiqlat Light
* Idiqlat Regular
