    <p>We are very pleased to announce the release of Idiqlat, a new
    font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The font name,
    Idiqlat, means “Tigris River” in ancient Akkadian/Assyrian. The
    emphasis is on the first syllable: EE-dee-klat.</p>
    <p>The font supports the complete range of Unicode characters
    required for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The East
    Syriac style is used primarily by the Assyrians (Church of the East)
    and Chaldeans. It is also used by the Syrian Orthodox in headings of
    texts.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>.
    However, significant design changes have been made in order to
    modernize and opitimize the font for web and mobile use.</p>
    <p>Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single,
    all-platforms package on the <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/font-idiqlat/releases">Download
    page</a>.</p>
